# Dofus Workshop

This project aims to gather some interesting features for dofus players, including:
- Daily Almanax offering
- Portals position, by server
- Recipes listing, to buy every ingredients without worrying about the details of counting the ingredients

Currently we want these feature to be all visible at once in the main page, but more features are to come
